This structure is pe_file_t that defines the pe file format sections.
In the very first structure of the binary "IMAGE_DOS_HEADER" is defined DOS stuff. See below:

typedef struct {
        uint16_t e_magic;
        uint16_t e_cblp;        //Bytes on last page of file
        uint16_t e_cp;          //Pages in file
        uint16_t e_crlc;        //Relocations
        uint16_t e_cparhdr;     //Size of headers in paragraphs
        uint16_t e_minalloc;    //Minimum extra paragraphs needed
        uint16_t e_maxalloc;    //Maximum extra paragraphs needed
        uint16_t e_ss;          //Initial (relative) SS value
        uint16_t e_sp;          //Initial SP value
        uint16_t e_csum;        //Checksum
        uint16_t e_ip;          //Initial IP value
        uint16_t e_cs;          //Initial (relative) CS value
        uint16_t e_lfarlc;      //File address of relocation table
        uint16_t e_ovno;        //Overlay number 
        uint16_t e_res[4];      //Reserved words 
        uint16_t e_oemid;       //OEM identifier (for e_oeminfo)
        uint16_t e_oeminfo;     //OEM information: e_oemid specific
        uint16_t e_res2[10];    //Reserved words
        int32_t e_lfanew; // sizeof(IMAGE_DOS_HEADER) + size of MS-DOS stub
} IMAGE_DOS_HEADER;

We care about only two fields in this structure: e_magic and e_lfanew. The value of e_magic is always 4D 5A which means 'MZ' in ASCII (for curiosity, MZ is from Mark Zbikowski who developed MS-DOS). The e_lfanew is a field that define the offset for the next field in owr structure pe_file_t.

uint32_t signature;

The next field is the signature with value 0x00004550, which is 'PE' in ASCII. Otherwise, is a ponter to the next structure.

Now we have the structure "IMAGE_COFF_HEADER" ilustrated below:
typedef struct {
        uint16_t Machine; // MachineType
        uint16_t NumberOfSections;
        uint32_t TimeDateStamp;
        uint32_t PointerToSymbolTable;
        uint32_t NumberOfSymbols;
        uint16_t SizeOfOptionalHeader;
        uint16_t Characteristics; // ImageCharacteristics
} IMAGE_FILE_HEADER, IMAGE_COFF_HEADER;

The first field, defines the machine type that can be found in the enum "MachineType" at libpe/hdr_coff.hi. This field is the first indication about 32 or 64 binary.
                                                                                                                                                                                                 1,7           Top
Then the NumberOfSections that defines the number of sections that the binary have imediatelly after the optional header. The TimeDateStamp field defines the time that the binary was linked.
